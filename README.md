# Wanderlust
#Wanderlust is an educational IoT project considering the connection of the "web of things" and the "pyhsical web" in an an real world example.The specific context of this study works condcuted @Hermann Holerrith Center for informatics and Economy with focus on the digital transformation will be explained to you in the subsequent section.

To give an insite into the first question which will most probaley arise while you are reading this file is: What exactly is this so called real world example adressing?

As the name of the project "Wanderlust" already says by its definition the project covers the topic of hiking in the mountains in a very enjoyable and natural way while enriching the hiking experience with IoT technologies. 

Now to the second  question which will arise while reading this README file: Where is the connection between internet of things or web of things and the activity hiking?

To bring this question to a the prettey simple point respectively to a short answer: 

Hiking itself is a very relaxing and quite enjoyable activity for which many people spend a certain part of their freetime (and you should pracitce it as much as you can as it combines fresh air under hopefully clear sky whith a certain amount of pyhsical acitvtiy). Though noting is better to keep up a clear and open mind for the stressfull challgenes of your every day life.

However, hiking can be a quite inconvenient task during the planning respecitvely the explorational phase of your hiking trip. The reason for this fact is quite obvious. If you are not a semi-professional hiker knowing exactely where to go, which difficulty to manage during the hike and how long exactely your trip will take as well as how enjoyable is the track you select, you will struggle to organize it.

What exactely is ment with "organize it": During the period before you can start your hopefully enjoyable hiking trip you are forced to run throught certain planning steps covering the selection of the track, the planning of breaks and the location of food supply as well as the most enjoyable path fulfilling your personal expectations which come along with your wishes, interests and personal as well as team related condition. Furthermore one point we quite explicitly focus on is the topic of navigating during your hike, which maybe one of the most outstanding aspects the proposed sulotion setup is adressing.

To summarize the core outputs of the text above and come to the principal solution:

Up to now you buy hiking guides either locally "at the point of hike" (eg. at the toursit information) or as physical guide or map you buy upfront or you download as a peace of software via the internet in form of an navigation or information mobilephone application. These so called "helpers" cause an interaction by their nature of their  application to get a eihter location based realtime information during or upfront your trip during the socalled "planning phase". 
The application of these manifold guides subsequently dispel your free mind and the experince you have in the moutains as you are forced to interrupt your actual hiking action by interacting with a book, map or app.

To come now to our solution to resolve or prevent the descirbed inconvenience: 
Starting point: The hiker literally does not want to have a certain kind of interuption during his hike due to an interaction with these information media. The hiker just want to start his "mountain journey" at the starting point, which is most probaly the parking space in and the view on a huge confusing locally installed hiking map. 

Situation which is most common and really "everyone of you know this situation"!:
"Damn...where is the orange point which shows me my acutal loction"..."more damn as the way we have pre-selected is not show or can not be identifed on the map...or literally no one isintereseted in observing all these unconvenient maps at all..." 

SOOO... now you are exactely at the point where our IoT vision starts: 
We will enrich you hiking experience with on-site enable information sources regarding navigation, experience planning (what to see and where), safty aspects (avalanches, Jetis and other impediments which maybe come up).
How we do this...easy...we located certain beacons at the hot points of your so-called "customer journey" giving you the information need in a smooth and seemless way which on one hand do not require upfront planning and on the other will increase your "customer experience". 
Get the hike and track you want on demand, on time and without any effort...in an proactive way, which does not belittle your hiking experience...
