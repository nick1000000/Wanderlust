#WANDERLUST

Wanderlust is an educational IoT project considering the connection of the "web of things" and the "pyhsical web" in a real world example.

The study work was conducted in context of the lecture Internet of Things (IoT) in the course Digital Business Management at the Hermann Hollerith Centre (HHZ). 

The HHZ is the teaching and research centre from the informatics faculty of the University for Applied Science of Reutlingen.
